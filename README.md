# Mr Smiley Game README

This is a simple and ill-advised game written as a VSCode Extension. Why? Why not?
In all seriousness, I made this just to see if it could be done and it exists more as a proof-of-concept than a real, full-featured game.
At the very least, it shows an simple way to take input and refresh the screen in the editor. I don't know how useful that is, but it's interesting.

## Features

Amazing 8-bit ascii action in 2 colors!

The point of the game is to collect as many coins as fast as possible and reach the goal while avoiding the enemies.

## Requirements

There are no requirements. To run the game, open a new file and execute the "Adeventures of Mr. Smiley" command.
If you don't open a new file, it will clear out whatever is open to render the game... which you probably don't want. 
After you win or get a game over, press space bar to reset the game.

## Extension Settings

There are no settings for this game. However, for optimal gameplay, it might be better to zoom in a little and disable editor.quickSuggestions in user preferences so it won't pop up over and over.

## Known Issues

Nothing known at this time, but it's a game in a text editor, I'm pretty sure it can be broken easily.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial release. There might or might not be more releases.

### 0.0.2

Fixed game reset bug. The game should now properly reset after a game over/win.

### 0.0.3

Minor changes. The game now resets by pressing "space bar" after a game over/win.

### 0.0.4

Changed the game to reset the cursor to the bottom left so it's *slightly* more difficult to break in the case of a random click.

### 0.0.5

Changed Mr Smiley to a spooky ghost for Halloween. This might get left in for months due to laziness.

### 0.0.6

Back to normal, because I broke everything.

**Enjoy!**
