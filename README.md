# Mr Smiley Game README

This is a simple and ill-advised game written as a VSCode Extension. Why? Why not?

## Features

Amazing 8-bit ascii action in 2 colors!

The point of the game is to collect as many coins as fast as possible and reach the goal while avoiding the enemies.

## Requirements

There are no requirements. To run the game, open a new file and execute the "Adeventures of Mr. Smiley" command.

## Extension Settings

There are no settings for this game. However, for optimal gameplay, it might be better to zoom in a little and disable editor.quickSuggestions in user preferences so it won't pop up over and over.

## Known Issues

Resetting the game after a win or game over seems to have some issues. It might be better to start a new instance the game instead at the moment.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release.

**Enjoy!**
